                I believe that our society is currently unprepared for the impending challenges that humanity will face.
                 Many people cling to ideologies that promote not just physical weakness, but also impair various cognitive functions that constitute an individual. 
                 These ideologies employ strategies of sensationalism and inherited mentality to cultivate a collective consciousness, molded in the image of its deviant creators. This collective consciousness, or ‘hive mind’, is a reflection of the darker aspects of those who propagate these ideologies. 
                 Certain organizations, under the guise of a heartfelt plea for peace and safety, seek control and power. Ironically, these very demands often lead to the outbreak of wars, wars that the members of these organizations are too timid and complacent to participate in. Moreover, the stronghold of classism on the accepted language etiquette of the 21st century has left many fearful of voicing their opinions. The evolving lexicon, filled with newly coined terms, can leave an individual feeling isolated and desolate.
                The ultimate aim of these organizations is to suppress and overshadow an individual’s right to freedom of speech. The advent of AI and other technological advancements provides the potential for significant impact, both positive and negative. This impact allows the truths we hold to endure, as long as they can withstand scrutiny. An idea, if it stands the test of time, can be more powerful than the most potent nuclear bombs. Such an impact has the capacity to construct or dismantle societies, governments, or collective consciousness for generations until the final reckoning. This power enables us to break away from groupthink and recognize ourselves as individuals who can separate from the herd to establish a family lineage that honors the spirits of our ancestors, all while maintaining anonymity.
                 In conclusion, I encourage you to continually question everything, extend respect to all, and embrace your unique individuality.
