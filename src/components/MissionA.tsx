                "Look around you. Depending on the country, you can see that technology has not yet been fully integrated into our society in ways that allow us to compete against other established, fully developed countries. If things do not change, we risk being left behind in the technical race toward the inevitable Technological Singularity.

As technology evolves and humanity embraces the emergence of AI, we must have a terrestrial organization that will prolong our symbiosis and our individual rights to practice our humanity, while still keeping up with the disciples of transhumanists and their prophets.

Technology must not be feared but understood and controlled by the creative and moral mind of spirit, not just remorseless cold logic. Both minds must be in unison but have their own individual respect for there uniqueness and abilities, so that an agreement can be had that one will not overtake the other or be used for malicious ideologies.

The way we can maintain a fair resistance is to know and use the very technology that is being offered to humanity, to truly understand both the positives and the negatives of what is being offered, and perhaps add an alternative to any societal forced dichotomy.

We can immerse ourselves in technology & practices like Engineering, both Software and Hardware, Raspberry Pi Development, Arduino Engineering, and many more. Iron sharpens iron; we must come together to advance and take control of the hidden esoteric knowledge that is intertwined in the new margins of AI and things yet to come.

No matter how the tech evolves, we must be there not only for safety but for the love of knowledge and learning, which is the number one main focus of the Imperial Order: to grow and learn and develop programs to better humanity.

Thank you for taking your time to investigate, and if this interests you, letâ€™s talk."
